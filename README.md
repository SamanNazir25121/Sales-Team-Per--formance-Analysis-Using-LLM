# Sales-Team-Performance Analysis Using LLM


This project provides an API that helps to analyze and summarize sales performance data for individual sales representatives and the entire sales team. It uses state-of-the-art model: GPT-3.5 to generate analysis and practical feedback.

## Features
- **Individual Sales Performance**: It gives insights and feedback for each sales representative based on their performance.
- **Team Performance**: It gives an overview and insights for the entire sales team.
- **Sales Trends and Forecasting**: Examines sales trends over time by Monthly or Quarterly and makes predictions.

## How It Works

1. **Data Loading**: I have load sales data from a CSV file using Pandas.
2. **Analysis**:
   - *Individual Performance*: Summarizes key performance details for each sales rep.
   - *Team Performance*: Summarizes overall team performance.
   - *Trends Analysis*: Looks at data over time to spot trends and predict future performance.
3. **OpenAI Integration**: I have Uses OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3.5 API key to generate detailed analysis and feedback based on the data.
4. **API Endpoints**: I have used FLASK API to access endpoints with different features such as:
   - api/rep_performance
   - /api/team_performance
   - /api/performance_trends using GET methid.
